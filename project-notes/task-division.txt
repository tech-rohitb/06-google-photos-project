   - Create a grid layout to display photo thumbnails.
   - Implement pagination or infinite scrolling if needed.

2. **Photo Metadata:**
   - Allow sorting of photos by date, album, or tags.
   - Display metadata for each photo in the grid.

3. **Photo Details:**
   - Implement a modal view to display larger photo and metadata.
   - Add options to edit metadata and delete the photo.

### Sprint 3: Album Management and Search Functionality

**Backend Developer:**
1. **Manage Albums:**
   - Set up routes and controllers for creating, renaming, and deleting albums.
   - Implement logic to add photos to albums.
   - Fetch album cover photos and photo counts.

2. **Search Functionality:**

**Frontend Developer:**
1. **Manage Albums:**
   - Create UI components to create, rename, and delete albums.
   - Allow users to add photos to albums.
   - Display album cover photos and photo counts.

2. **Search Functionality:**
   - Implement a search bar to filter photos by date, location, or tags.
   - Display search results dynamically as the user types.

### Summary

**Backend Developer Responsibilities:**
- User authentication (routes, controllers, authentication logic).
- Photo upload (routes, controllers, file handling, compression).
- Fetching and organizing photos (routes, controllers, pagination, sorting).
- Managing photo metadata (routes, controllers, updating, deleting).
- Album management (routes, controllers, logic for creating, renaming, deleting albums, adding photos to albums).
- Implementing search functionality (routes, controllers for filtering photos).

**Frontend Developer Responsibilities:**
- Creating and styling forms for registration, login, password reset.
- Handling authentication logic and storing tokens.
- Creating and styling photo upload form with progress indicator.
- Implementing photo grid layout and handling pagination/infinite scrolling.
- Implementing sorting and displaying photo metadata.
- Creating modal view for detailed photo display with edit/delete options.
- Creating UI components for album management (create, rename, delete, add photos).
- Implementing search bar and dynamically displaying search results.

By dividing the tasks this way, both the front-end and back-end developers can work in parallel, ensuring efficient progress towards the MVP.
