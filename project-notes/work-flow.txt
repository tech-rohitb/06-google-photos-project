5. **Sharing and Collaboration:**
   - I can share albums or individual photos with other users via email or link.
     - **Backend:** Implement endpoints for generating shareable links and handling permissions for shared content.

6. **Performance and Scalability:**
   - The application should handle large volumes of photos efficiently.
     - **Backend:** Optimize database queries and implement caching where necessary.
   - Operations like uploading, deleting, and searching should be fast and responsive.
     - **Backend:** Ensure efficient handling of these operations with optimized code and appropriate indexing in the database.

**Frontend:**

1. **Upload Photos:**
   - Progress indicators should show the upload status for each photo.
     - **Frontend:** Implement progress bars for file uploads.

2. **View and Organize Photos:**
   - I can view thumbnails of all uploaded photos in a grid layout.
     - **Frontend:** Implement grid and list templates for displaying photo thumbnails.
   - Clicking on a photo should open a larger view with options to edit metadata or delete the photo.
     - **Frontend:** Implement modal view for larger photo display with edit and delete options.

3. **Manage Albums:**
   - Each album should display its cover photo and total number of photos.
     - **Frontend:** Display cover photo and count of photos in each album.

4. **Search Functionality:**

6. **Responsive Design:**
   - The application should be responsive and accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
     - **Frontend:** Ensure responsiveness for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
   - Photo thumbnails and controls should adjust to different screen sizes.
     - **Frontend:** Use responsive design techniques (media queries, flexible grids).
